How does it interpret that input?

The string has no new lines, so it's one "block"
The block doesn't start with #, so it's a paragraph (<p>) not a header. The whole output will be wrapped in <p> and </p>
Part of the input, *hello*, is wrapped in asterisks. That's the Markdown marker for emphasis. So that fragment hello will be wrapped in <em> and </em>
